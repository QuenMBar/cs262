I find their idea very interesting because they identified a need that people have and a way that they can fix it.  It is a unique idea 
that has the potential to be helpful.  I think that they’re right that one of the biggest hurtles to adoption is finding the right animal.  
The main part of their app seems to be connecting dog breeds with personalities, but if they could take it a step farther and connect 
them with actual animals ready to be adopted it would be truly amazing.  However, I’d be surprised if they’d have the time to implement 
this given how little they have to make the app.  Their vision statement is well written because I was able to get a good idea of their 
end goal for their project from it.  

Their prototype code looks good besides there isn’t any documentation.  However, given that it is just a hello world app at the moment, 
I am not worried about it.
