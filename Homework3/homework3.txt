a. Is the service RESTful? If not, why not? If so, what key features make it RESTful.
	Yes, this service is restful because it uses the http methods and is stateless.  It doesn’t remember the 
	previous methods that were used so it is stateless.  
b. What endpoints implement actions that are idempotent? nullipotent?
	Get, put, and delete are idempotent because it doesn’t matter if you call them again once you called them 
	once.  They won’t be updating anything after the first.  However, Get is nullipotent because it doesn’t 
	matter if you call them 0 or 1 time.  It doesn’t update the server the first time its called.
c. What evidence, if any, do you see of the commonly-cited impedance mismatch problem in object-relational information systems?
	There is a lot of evidence of impedance mismatch, being encapsulation, and mapping object oriented to relational.
d. Would the web service built in the lab be susceptible to SQL-injection attacks?
	Yes it would be since it isn’t very secure.  It would be pretty easy to inject bad data into the database.
