a. Do their project management materials show the appropriate amount of activity?
	Yes, while sprint 4 looks a little bare, their earlier sprints I think make up for it.  While they have a lot of the individual 
	components done, they still need to stitch them all together.
b. Write a one-to-two-paragraph review of their models. Is their database schema well-formulated?
	Their ui model is very well put together.  It shows everything that’s needed and doesn’t get too cluttered.  Their domain model 
	is nice and simple.  It has connection between dogs and humans, which is all that their app needs and makes their app understandable.  
	Finally, their database model is a lot more complex.  Since they have a lot of data to keep track of, this is understandable.  But the 
	model is well thought out and shouldn’t be that hard to implement.
c. Has there been an appropriate amount of code pushed into their client and server repos? Can you run the prototype and/or the database?
	Their database doesn’t seem to be working yet, but I can run their demo.  Its still fairly skeletal in terms for design and functionality, 
	but they have all the frame work in place to make everything they wanted to.  However, I am a little worried with how much they have left to do.
d. Was their design presentation effective? What worked? What didn’t work? How would you rate their presentation relative to the others?
	I think it worked very well.  First, all their slides were very well thought out, and were entertaining and it helped keep people engaged.  
	Second, they demonstrated their app well, and I think really sold the idea for their app.  They always made sure to talk about how this 
	app would help people find dogs to adopt.
