a. Write a one-paragraph review of their user test. Was it well-planned and executed? Was there a sufficient amount of system functionality to test?
	The user test was well implimented.  It ran well and i had most of the functionality ready to be tested.  They were well prepared and it didnt seem like anything took them by suprise.

b. Has there been an appropriate amount of code pushed into their client repo?
	Yes, it seems like theyre all contributing and its all coming together.
