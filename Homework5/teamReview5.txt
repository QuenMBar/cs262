Do their project management materials show the appropriate amount of activity throughout the 
semester? Base this on your previous reviews and your most recent observations.
	Their trello shows that they have all put in a good amount of hours into their projects as a 
	whole, and that theyre all working together as a team to finish it up.  Their github shows that 
	alot of them have been active on it, and that theyve all been pretty active.

Was their final presentation effective? How would you rate their presentation relative to both their 
previous presentation and to the other final presentations?
	There final presentation was very effective. First of all, they were really energetic about their app 
	and clearly had rehersed their presentation alot.  It was good that they got the crowd involved with the quiz.
	The app as a whole was really cleaned up compared to past versions.  However, there were a few bugs with the
	database element.  Also the actual dog at the end was a good touch.

Review of their final application. Base this on their final presentation demo and their submitted code.
	Their final application looks good.  As long as the bug with there database is fixable, i think they
	have a really solid app.  Their github code looks really profesional, and is well documented.
